I'm a software engineer focused on developing mobile apps and I'm building a few things at Noknox.

I really love to understand how things work behind the scenes and so I acquired skills in back-end and front-end, so I consider myself a full-stack developer.

Today I am passionate and proficient in the following technologies: Android, Flutter, React, React-native, Dart, Kotlin, ASP.NET Core, NodeJs, TypeScript, ES6 and Docker
